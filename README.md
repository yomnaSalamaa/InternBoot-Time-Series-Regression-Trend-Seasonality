### ***📈 Time Series Regression: Trend + Seasonality***

This project explores how to adapt regression models for time series forecasting by capturing both trend and seasonality in retail sales data. Along the way, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying sales dynamics.

The dataset comes from the 🛒 Store Sales – [Time Series Forecasting competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-seriesforecasting)
.


**🎯 Objectives**

Perform EDA to uncover sales patterns, seasonal effects, and holiday impacts.

Extend regression to handle time-dependent patterns.

Capture trend using polynomial features on a time index.

Model seasonality with month, day-of-week, and holiday indicators.

Compare extended regression vs. a baseline linear regression.


**🛠 Features for Modeling**

Trend Features → Linear + Polynomial time index

Seasonality Features → Month, Day-of-Week, Holidays

Holiday Effects → Integrated from external holiday dataset

Lag Features → Past sales values & rolling averages

Visualization → Actual vs. Predicted sales (aggregated monthly)


📊 Tech Stack

🐍 Python

🐼 Pandas

📘 Scikit-learn

📉 Matplotlib


**🚀 Learning Outcomes**

Applied EDA techniques for time series.

Learned how to engineer time-aware features.

Understood differences between trend and seasonality.

Compared baseline vs. enhanced regression models.

Strengthened skills in time series forecasting & visualization.
